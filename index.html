                <h4 class="T"> I visited Salzburg, Austria in June 2019 </h4>
                <p class="T"> Salzburg is the capital city of the State of Salzburg and fourth-largest city in Austria. In 2020, it had a population of 156,872.

                    The town is located on the site of the former Roman settlement of Iuvavum. Salzburg was founded as an episcopal see in 696 and became a seat of the archbishop in 798. Its main sources of income were salt extraction and trade and, at times, gold mining. The fortress of Hohensalzburg, one of the largest medieval fortresses in Europe, dates from the 11th century. In the 17th century, Salzburg became a centre of the Counter-Reformation, where monasteries and numerous Baroque churches were built.

                    Salzburg's historic centre is thus renowned for its Baroque architecture and is one of the best-preserved city centres north of the Alps, with 27 churches. It was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. The city has three universities and a large population of students. Tourists also visit Salzburg to tour the historic centre and the scenic Alpine surroundings. Salzburg was the birthplace of the 18th-century composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Because of its history, culture, and attractions, Salzburg has been labeled Austria's "most inspiring city."</p>

                    Middle School: The Worst Years of My Life is a 2016 American live-action/animated family comedy film directed by Steve Carr. Transfer student Rafe Khatchadorian has an overactive imagination and is very passionate about his artistic talent and lives in a middle-class home with his mother Jules, his rebellious younger sister Georgia, and Jules's lazy, child-hating boyfriend (later fiancé) Bear. Rafe cannot wait to start his first day at Hills Village Middle School, but it does not go as he hopes when he finds out that Principal Dwight, and most of the teachers at the school, are very cruel and much worse than the bullies.

                    After Dwight destroys Rafe's sketchbook by throwing it into a bucket full of acid, Rafe and his best friend Leo come up with an idea to start a massive "insurrection" to go up against Principal Dwight, breaking every rule in the rule book. They unleash several pranks on Principal Dwight and the school staff, including putting sticky notes all over the school, filling Gus the janitor's closet with plastic balls, dyeing Principal Dwight's hair pink, and turning the school's trophy case into a fish tank.

Her narrative songwriting, which often takes inspiration from her personal life, has received widespread critical praise and media coverage.

                    Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, in 2004 to pursue a career in country music. She broke into the country music scene with her eponymous debut studio album in 2006, which featured the singles "Teardrops on My Guitar" and "Our Song". Swift rose to mainstream prominence with her second studio album, Fearless (2008), a country pop record with crossover appeal. Aided by the top-ten singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me", Fearless was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Swift's third studio album, Speak Now (2010), blended country pop with elements of rock, featuring the top-ten singles "Mine" and "Back to December".

                    Drawing inspiration from various pop, rock, and electronic genres, Swift's fourth studio album Red (2012) saw her transcending her country roots. She moved to pop with her synth-pop fifth studio album, 1989 (2014), and expanded the electropop sound on her next two studio albums, Reputation (2017) and Lover (2019), which respectively embraced urban and retro styles. The four albums spawned a string of international top-five singles, including "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", "I Knew You Were Trouble", "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", "Bad Blood", "Look What You Made Me Do", and "Me!". In 2020, Swift experimented with folk and alternative rock on her eighth and ninth studio albums, Folklore and Evermore, whose lead singles "Cardigan" and "Willow" topped charts around the world, and released the documentaries Miss Americana and Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions.

                    With sales of over 200 million records worldwide, Swift is one of the best-selling music artists. Her accolades include 11 Grammy Awards (including three Album of the Year wins), an Emmy Award, 28 Guinness World Records, 32 American Music Awards (the most wins by an artist), and 23 Billboard Music Awards (the most wins by a woman).

Her 1950s doo-wop-influenced pop and R&B debut album, Yours Truly (2013), topped the US Billboard 200 chart, while its lead single, "The Way", charted in the top ten of the US Billboard Hot 100. Upon release, critics compared Grande to Mariah Carey for her wide vocal range and whistle register.

                    Grande maintained her pop and R&B sound on her second and third studio albums, My Everything (2014), and Dangerous Woman (2016), with the former exploring EDM and producing the UK number-one singles "Problem", and "Bang Bang", and the latter becoming her first of four consecutive number-one albums in the UK Singles Chart. Her personal struggles influenced her trap-infused fourth and fifth studio albums, Sweetener (2018) and Thank U, Next (2019), which were both critical and commercial successes. The former won Grande a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album, while the latter broke the record for the largest streaming week for a pop album, and was nominated for the Album of the Year. The singles "Thank U, Next", "7 Rings", and "Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored" made Grande the first solo artist to hold the top three spots on the Billboard Hot 100 simultaneously, and the first woman to succeed herself at the top of the UK. In 2020, her collaborations "Stuck with U" with Justin Bieber and "Rain on Me" with Lady Gaga helped her break the record for most number-one debuts on the Hot 100. Grande's R&B-influenced sixth studio album, Positions (2020), and its title track, debuted at number-one in the UK and US.

                    She has received numerous accolades throughout her career, including two Grammy Awards, one Brit Award, two Billboard Music Awards, three American Music Awards, nine MTV Video Music Awards, and 22 Guinness World Records. Grande also holds several Billboard Hot 100 chart records; among the above, she is also the only artist to have five number-one debuts, to have their first five number one singles debut at the top spot, to have three number one-debuts in one calendar year, and to have all lead singles from each of her first six studio albums debut in the top ten. Grande's first five full-length albums have been certified platinum or multi-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Having amassed billions of streams thus far, Grande is the most streamed female artist on Spotify and Apple Music, and is currently the most followed solo female artist on Spotify, and YouTube. She has been included on Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world (2016 and 2019) and on Forbes Celebrity 100 (2019 and 2020), while Billboard has honored her as Woman of the Year (2018), the greatest pop star of 2019, and the most accomplished female artist to debut in the 2010s. Aside from music, Grande is known for her fashion and signature ponytail hairdo. She has been the most followed woman on Instagram since 2019.
